_Masked_Man

This was the question that i saw others solving after day1 and got interested in bi0s ctf and then registered asap after calling and confirming with adithyakrishnan chettan . 
basically i took this audio and uploaded it into a website and downloaded the application called audacity . at first i didnt know how to use it so i used youtube to learn about spectrograms and then could change the audio to an image . the image was of ryan reynolds who was the actor of deadpool (thus named masked man ). then the format of the question is ddmmyyyy so i knew its a date and searched and tried a lot of dates but none of them worked . so i left it , on the next day i came to know that the answer was his birsthday(i tried it b4 and got wrong)then i tried it again and got it . sadly only 10 points at the end .
